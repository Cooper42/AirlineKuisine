	@description = Reinventing the classic cabin was a decision met with surprisingly little criticism from investers. In our best interest (and that of the passengers, of course), we gutted the classic cabin and refitted the intenals with just two recliners, a few decorative fixed things, an LED screen and left enough room for little ones...if they so happen...to merrily wiggle around.

	@description = As is the case with the short Rec Centre, this one enables crew to make a great or greater home in a spaceplane, but the scope of use is more focused. Staff and clientelle alike can expect to find truly first class amenities or community facilities and lots of private space here, rather than live in the game room. We've built a concept space kitchen into this one, with novel facilities which require a masterful scientist in order to operate at top performance and feed a small group at once.
