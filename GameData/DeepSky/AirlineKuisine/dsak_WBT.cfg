	title = Mk3 Processor A
	description = This processor is a discreet Snack Grinder. It churns out a steady supply of alright but not-particularly amazing snacks... And at 5x the capacity of its kindred Mk2 version.

	title = Mk3 Processor B
	description = The MPH (Multi-Purpose Hab) Estudio is, in spite of its lineage, an un-crewed machine. While it cannot hold kerbals for itself, it can do everything that the Hacienda IMF can. By default it is configured for a Greenhouse.

{
	name = dsak_proc_3c
	title = Mk3 Processor C
	description = This processor is a general purpose ISRU and a surface Prospector. It is as useful as the Buffalo ISRU or WBI Mini ISRU, but appropriately more powerful at 3x the ability of its kindred Mk2 ISRU.
