	description = Versatility and Seamlessness are two watchwords that are minded very closely with this highly advanced device. Capable of the roles of three or four 1.25m converters simultaneously, or some of the functions of large and exotic machinery, the DS Mk3 Processor answers the call in-situ, like a badS. Depending on the life support system, seating may be provided inside for crew. Be sure to evacuate them when changing the life support system!!!
