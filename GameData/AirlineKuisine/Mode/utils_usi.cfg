	@description = Reinventing the classic cabin was a decision met with surprising amounts of approval from both C7 and USI... Not that C7 was expected to have a problem with the proposal anyway. Now with only 2 motorized recliners (with seatbelts) instead of 4 cramped airline seats and edge tables, there's plenty room for crew or tourists to stow and unpack novelty things, live like they're home, and let little ones crawl or float around all over the place.

	@description = Deep Sky's Airline Kuisine division sought to ensure that those long flights on a spaceplane or other craft that straddle the line between a plane and a station are more livable. No such prospect is complete without a form-fitting greenhouse module. This greenhouse functions at 80% the capacity of a Nom-O-Matic 25000.

	@description = Rather than using the classical cylindrical volume within the Mk2 hull, the entire internal volume is leveraged to contain essential biological and mechanical components. It reduces the consumption load for 3, as does the RT-5000, but it marginally outperforms RT-500 per kerbal.
