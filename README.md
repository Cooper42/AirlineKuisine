# Deep Sky Airline Kuisine
## Everyone's favorite life support in everyone's favorite shape
Version 0.6
  
Another mod for [Kerbal Space Program](http://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/), and very simple compared to other mods out there. This is a very small parts pack that provides tanks and converters in the Mk2 spaceplane form factor, whose textures and functions change depending on the life support system installed beside them.

There is a small issue of the TAC resources adding onto the parts when Snacks is installed. It's easily resolved by deleting the TAC configs from the Mode folder, preferably before launching KSP in the first place.
